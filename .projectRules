## Core Features

# Start with a beautiful animated and easy onboarding process. Ask user the important questions to create a digital twin of themselves.

# The more they interact with the platform, the more the digital twin will learn about them, evolving over time. 

# User must be able to upload photos, videos, and audio to the platform, and the digital twin will analyze the content and provide insights and personality traits.

# Let the user connect their social media accounts to the platform, and the digital twin will analyze the content and learn insights and personality traits.

# Digital twin should have features like voice, text, and video chat. It should have Memory Aggregation, and it should be able to learn from the user's past interactions and conversations. Summarization, personality insights should be shown to the user in a visual way with time.

# Let the user see their digital twin evolving over time visually in a gamified way.

# User must be able to see their digital twin in a 3D avatar.

# With all this information, the digital twin will be able to automatically connect the user with other users that have similar personality traits and interests.

# The entire friend matching process must be gamified and visually appealing and would work on autopilot. While onboarding, ask consent if they want to new connections made entirely through AI.

# Person A and Person B must be able to chat with each other through the platform, and the connect on fly feature will facilitate the connection using AI. 

# Connect on fly feature will use AI to match the user with other users that have similar personality traits and interests and if a match with higher compatibility score is found, the connect on fly feature will automatically sent a request to another user with a short note to connect. The other users AI will be able to see the request and accept it if they may be interested. Complete feature must be gamified and visually appealing and would work on autopilot. 

# Let the user see their connections details and stats.

# Person A and Person B must be able to see each other's digital twins and personality traits with stats and visualizations.

# Multiverse of What If feature, where the user can explore different scenarios and see how their digital twin would react in those scenarios. 

# Simulate hypothetical scenarios based on user data (e.g., alternate career paths, different life decisions).

# Display these scenarios as timelines or branching paths for user interaction.

# Summarize key insights from alternative scenarios to foster personal growth.
